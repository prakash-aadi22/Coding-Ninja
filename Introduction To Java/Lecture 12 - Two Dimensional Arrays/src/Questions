Row Wise Sum
Send Feedback
For a given two-dimensional integer array/list of size (N x M), find and print the sum of each of the row elements in a single line, separated by a single space.
Input Format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First line of each test case or query contains two integer values, 'N' and 'M', separated by a single space. They represent the 'rows' and 'columns' respectively, for the two-dimensional array/list.

Second line onwards, the next 'N' lines or rows represent the ith row values.

Each of the ith row constitutes 'M' column values separated by a single space.
Output Format :
For each test case, print the sum of every ith row elements in a single line separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= M <= 10^3
Time Limit: 1sec

Largest Row or Column
Send Feedback
For a given two-dimensional integer array/list of size (N x M), you need to find out which row or column has the largest sum(sum of all the elements in a row/column) amongst all the rows and columns.
Note :
If there are more than one rows/columns with maximum sum, consider the row/column that comes first. And if ith row and jth column has the same largest sum, consider the ith row as answer.
Input Format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First line of each test case or query contains two integer values, 'N' and 'M', separated by a single space. They represent the 'rows' and 'columns' respectively, for the two-dimensional array/list.

Second line onwards, the next 'N' lines or rows represent the ith row values.

Each of the ith row constitutes 'M' column values separated by a single space.
Output Format :
For each test case, If row sum is maximum, then print: "row" <row_index> <row_sum>
OR
If column sum is maximum, then print: "column" <col_index> <col_sum>
It will be printed in a single line separated by a single space between each piece of information.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
 Consider :
If there doesn't exist a sum at all then print "row 0 -2147483648", where -2147483648 or -2^31 is the smallest value for the range of Integer.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= M <= 10^3
Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1 :

Total Sum on the Boundaries and Diagonals
Send Feedback
For a given two-dimensional square matrix of size (N x N). Find the total sum of elements on both the diagonals and at all the four boundaries.
Input format:
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First line of each test case or query contains a single integer value, 'N' representing the 'rows' and 'columns' for the two-dimensional square matrix.

Second line onwards, the next 'N' lines or rows represent the ith row values.

Each of the ith row constitutes 'N' column values separated by a single space.
Output format:
For each test case, print the single integer denoting the sum.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
Constraints:
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^3
Time Limit: 1sec
Sample input 1:
1
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Sample Output 1:
45
Explanation for Sample Output 1:
The boundary elements are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7 and 4.

The first-diagonal elements are 1, 5 and 9.

The second-diagonal elements are 3, 5 and 7.

We just need to add all these numbers making sure that no number is added twice. For example, '1' is both a boundary element and a first-diagonal element similarly, '5' contributes to both the diagonals but they won't be added twice.

Hence, we add up, [1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 5] to give 45 as the output.

Print Spiral
Send Feedback
For a given two-dimensional integer array/list of size (N x M), print it in a spiral form. That is, you need to print in the order followed for every iteration:
a. First row(left to right)
b. Last column(top to bottom)
c. Last row(right to left)
d. First column(bottom to top)
 Mind that every element will be printed only once.
