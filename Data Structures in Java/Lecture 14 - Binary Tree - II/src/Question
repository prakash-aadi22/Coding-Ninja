Diameter Of Binary Tree
Send Feedback
For a given Binary of type integer, find and return the ‘Diameter’.
Diameter of a Tree
The diameter of a tree can be defined as the maximum distance between two leaf nodes.
Here, the distance is measured in terms of the total number of nodes present along the path of the two leaf nodes, including both the leaves.
Example:
alt txt

The maximum distance can be seen between the leaf nodes 8 and 9.
The distance is 9 as there are a total of nine nodes along the longest path from 8 to 9(inclusive of both). Hence the diameter according to the definition will be 9.
Input Format:
The first and the only line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints an integer, representing the diameter of the tree.
Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Create & Insert Duplicate Node
Send Feedback
For a given a Binary Tree of type integer, duplicate every node of the tree and attach it to the left of itself.
The root will remain the same. So you just need to insert nodes in the given Binary Tree.
Example:
alt txt

After making the changes to the above-depicted tree, the updated tree will look like this.
alt txt

You can see that every node in the input tree has been duplicated and inserted to the left of itself.
Input format :
The first and the only line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.
Output Format :
The updated tree will be printed in a level order fashion where each level will be printed on a new line.
Elements on every level will be printed in a linear fashion. A single space will separate them.
 Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the function to achieve the desired structure of the tree.

Note:
All the node data will be unique and hence there will always exist a minimum and maximum node data.

Path Sum Root to Leaf
Send Feedback
For a given Binary Tree of type integer and a number K, print out all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of all the node data along the path is equal to K.
Example:
alt txt

If you see in the above-depicted picture of Binary Tree, we see that there are a total of two paths, starting from the root and ending at the leaves which sum up to a value of K = 13.

The paths are:
a. 2 3 4 4
b. 2 3 8

One thing to note here is, there is another path in the right sub-tree in reference to the root, which sums up to 13 but since it doesn't end at the leaf, we discard it.
The path is: 2 9 2(not a leaf)
 Input Format:
The first line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.

The second line of input contains an integer value K.
Output Format:
Lines equal to the total number of paths will be printed. All the node data in every path will be printed in a linear fashion taken in the order they appear from top to down bottom in the tree. A single space will separate them all.
Constriants:
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= K <= 10^8

Print nodes at distance k from node
Send Feedback
You are given a Binary Tree of type integer, a target node, and an integer value K.
Print the data of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node. The order in which they would be printed will not matter.
Example:
For a given input tree(refer to the image below):
1. Target Node: 5
2. K = 2
alt txt

Starting from the target node 5, the nodes at distance K are 7 4 and 1.
Input Format:
The first line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.

The second line of input contains two integers separated by a single space, representing the value of the target node and K, respectively.
Output Format:
All the node data at distance K from the target node will be printed on a new line.

The order in which the data is printed doesn't matter.
