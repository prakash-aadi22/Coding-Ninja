Code: Search word in Trie
Send Feedback
Implement the function SearchWord for the Trie class.
For a Trie, write the function for searching a word. Return true if the word is found successfully, otherwise return false.
Note : main function is given for your reference which we are using internally to test the code.

Count Words in Trie
Send Feedback
You are given the Trie class with following functions -
1. insertWord
2. removeWord
Now, you need to create one more function (named "countWords" ) which returns the number of words currently present in Trie in O(1) time complexity.
Note : You can change the already given functions in the Trie class, if required.

Pattern Matching
Send Feedback
Given a list of n words and a pattern p that we want to search. Check if the pattern p is present the given words or not. Return true if the pattern is present and false otherwise.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of n.
The following line contains n space separated words.
The following line contains a string, that denotes the value of the pattern p.
Output Format :
The first and only line of output contains true if the pattern is present and false otherwise.
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
4
abc def ghi cba
de
Sample Output 2 :
true
Sample Input 2 :
4
abc def ghi hg
hi
Sample Output 2 :
true
Sample Input 3 :
4
abc def ghi hg
hif
Sample Output 3 :
false

Palindrome Pair
Send Feedback
Given 'n' number of words, you need to find if there exist any two words which can be joined to make a palindrome or any word, which itself is a palindrome.
The function should return either true or false. You don't have to print anything.
Input Format :
The first line of the test case contains an integer value denoting 'n'.

The following contains 'n' number of words each separated by a single space.
Output Format :
The first and only line of output contains true if the conditions described in the task are met and false otherwise.
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
4
abc def ghi cba
Sample Output 1 :
true
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
"abc" and "cba" forms a palindrome
Sample Input 2 :
2
abc def
Sample Output 2 :
false
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
Neither their exists a pair which forms a palindrome, nor any of the words is a palindrome in itself. Hence, the output is 'false.'

Auto complete
Send Feedback
Given n number of words and an incomplete word w. You need to auto-complete that word w.
That means, find and print all the possible words which can be formed using the incomplete word w.
Note : Order of words does not matter.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of n.
The following line contains n space separated words.
The following line contains the word w, that has to be auto-completed.
Output Format :
Print all possible words in separate lines.
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
7
do dont no not note notes den
no
Sample Output 2 :
no
not
note
notes
Sample Input 2 :
7
do dont no not note notes den
de
Sample Output 2 :
den
Sample Input 3 :
7
do dont no not note notes den
nom
Sample Output 3 :
(Empty) There is no word which starts with "nom"
