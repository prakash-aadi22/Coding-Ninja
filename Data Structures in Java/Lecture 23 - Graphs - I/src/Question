Code : BFS Traversal
Send Feedback
Given an undirected and disconnected graph G(V, E), print its BFS traversal.
Note:
1. Here you need to consider that you need to print BFS path starting from vertex 0 only.
2. V is the number of vertices present in graph G and vertices are numbered from 0 to V-1.
3. E is the number of edges present in graph G.
4. Take graph input in the adjacency matrix.
5. Handle for Disconnected Graphs as well
Input Format :
The first line of input contains two integers, that denote the value of V and E.
Each of the following E lines contains space separated two integers, that denote that there exists an edge between vertex a and b.
Output Format :
Print the BFS Traversal, as described in the task.
Constraints :
0 <= V <= 1000

Code : All connected components

Given an undirected graph G(V,E), find and print all the connected components of the given graph G.
Note:
1. V is the number of vertices present in graph G and vertices are numbered from 0 to V-1.
2. E is the number of edges present in graph G.
3. You need to take input in main and create a function which should return all the connected components. And then print them in the main, not inside function.
Print different components in new line. And each component should be printed in increasing order (separated by space). Order of different components doesn't matter.
