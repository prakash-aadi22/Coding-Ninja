Largest BST
Send Feedback
Given a Binary tree, find the largest BST subtree. That is, you need to find the BST with maximum height in the given binary tree. You have to return the height of largest BST.
Input format :
The first line of input contains data of the nodes of the tree in level order form. The data of the nodes of the tree is separated by space. If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right nodes exist, therefore, it will not be a part of the data of any node.
Output format:
The first and only line of output contains the height of the largest BST.
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
5 10 6 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
Sample Output 1:
2

Replace with Sum of greater nodes
Send Feedback
Given a binary search tree, you have to replace each node's data with the sum of all nodes which are greater or equal than it. You need to include the current node's data also.
That is, if in given BST there is a node with data 5, you need to replace it with sum of its data (i.e. 5) and all nodes whose data is greater than or equal to 5.
Note: You don't need to return or print, just change the data of each node.
Input format:
The first line of input contains data of the nodes of the tree in level order form. The data of the nodes of the tree is separated by space. If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right nodes exist, therefore, it will not be a part of the data of any node.
Output format:
In the output, data of the nodes of the tree are printed in level order form. Each level of the tree is printed on a separate line.
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1 :
8 5 10 2 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
Sample Output 1 :
18
36 10
38 31
25

Print nodes at distance k from node
Send Feedback
You are given a Binary Tree of type integer, a target node, and an integer value K.
Print the data of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node. The order in which they would be printed will not matter.
Example:
For a given input tree(refer to the image below):
1. Target Node: 5
2. K = 2
alt txt

Starting from the target node 5, the nodes at distance K are 7 4 and 1.
Input Format:
The first line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.

The second line of input contains two integers separated by a single space, representing the value of the target node and K, respectively.
Output Format:
All the node data at distance K from the target node will be printed on a new line.

The order in which the data is printed doesn't matter.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
3 1
Sample Output 1:
9
6
Sample Input 2:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
3 3
Sample Output 2:
4
5

Pair sum in a BST
Send Feedback
Given a binary search tree and an integer S, find pair of nodes in the BST which sum to S. You can use extra space of the order of O(log n).
Note:
1. Assume BST contains all unique elements.
2. In a pair, print the smaller element first.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains data of the nodes of the tree in level order form. The data of the nodes of the tree is separated by space. If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right nodes exist, therefore, it will not be a part of the data of any node.
The following line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of S.
Output format:
You have to print each pair in a different line (pair elements separated by space). The order of different pairs, to be printed, does not matter.
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
8 5 10 2 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
12
Sample Output 1:
2 10
5 7
